# CogLang - Genetic Algorithm

A "Cognate Language" generated by a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm generated words in output.txt, which seem to resemble those in deterministic_output.txt, which had words mostly deterministically generated in https://github.com/hchiam/cognateLanguage.

## Genetic Algorithm:

To run an example:

```
python geneticAlgo_just1.py
```

To run on all the data in data.txt:

```
python geneticAlgo.py
```

--> This outputs to output.txt and best-scorers.txt

You can compare scores by running this:

```
python evaluator_old.py output.txt
```

or this:

```
python evaluator_old.py deterministic_output.txt
```

or even to compare with a previous run with an older genetic algorithm:

```
python evaluator_old.py previous_output.txt
```
